/*! \class QCustomPlot

  \brief The central class of the library. This is the QWidget which displays the plot and
  interacts with the user.

  For tutorials on how to use QCustomPlot, see the website\n
  https://www.qcustomplot.com/
*/

/* start of documentation of inline functions */

/*! \fn QCPSelectionRect *QCustomPlot::selectionRect() const

  Allows access to the currently used QCPSelectionRect instance (or subclass thereof), that is used
  to handle and draw selection rect interactions (see \ref setSelectionRectMode).

  \see setSelectionRect
*/

/*! \fn QCPLayoutGrid *QCustomPlot::plotLayout() const

  Returns the top level layout of this QCustomPlot instance. It is a \ref QCPLayoutGrid, initially
  containing just one cell with the main QCPAxisRect inside.
*/

/* end of documentation of inline functions */
/* start of documentation of signals */

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseDoubleClick(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse double click event.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mousePress(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse press event.

  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanism like range dragging. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag or \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseMove(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse move event.

  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanism like range dragging. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag or \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes.

  \warning It is discouraged to change the drag-axes with \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes here,
  because the dragging starting point was saved the moment the mouse was pressed. Thus it only has
  a meaning for the range drag axes that were set at that moment. If you want to change the drag
  axes, consider doing this in the \ref mousePress signal instead.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseRelease(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse release event.

  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanisms like object selection. So a
  slot connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref setInteractions or
  \ref QCPAbstractPlottable::setSelectable.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseWheel(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse wheel event.

  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanisms like range zooming. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoom, \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomAxes or \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomFactor.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::plottableClick(QCPAbstractPlottable *plottable, int dataIndex, QMouseEvent
  *event)

  This signal is emitted when a plottable is clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click and \a plottable is the plottable that received
  the click. The parameter \a dataIndex indicates the data point that was closest to the click
  position.

  \see plottableDoubleClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::plottableDoubleClick(QCPAbstractPlottable *plottable, int dataIndex,
  QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when a plottable is double clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click and \a plottable is the plottable that received
  the click. The parameter \a dataIndex indicates the data point that was closest to the click
  position.

  \see plottableClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::itemClick(QCPAbstractItem *item, QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when an item is clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click and \a item is the item that received the
  click.

  \see itemDoubleClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::itemDoubleClick(QCPAbstractItem *item, QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when an item is double clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click and \a item is the item that received the
  click.

  \see itemClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::axisClick(QCPAxis *axis, QCPAxis::SelectablePart part, QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when an axis is clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click, \a axis is the axis that received the click and
  \a part indicates the part of the axis that was clicked.

  \see axisDoubleClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::axisDoubleClick(QCPAxis *axis, QCPAxis::SelectablePart part, QMouseEvent
  *event)

  This signal is emitted when an axis is double clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click, \a axis is the axis that received the click and
  \a part indicates the part of the axis that was clicked.

  \see axisClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::legendClick(QCPLegend *legend, QCPAbstractLegendItem *item, QMouseEvent
  *event)

  This signal is emitted when a legend (item) is clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click, \a legend is the legend that received the
  click and \a item is the legend item that received the click. If only the legend and no item is
  clicked, \a item is \c nullptr. This happens for a click inside the legend padding or the space
  between two items.

  \see legendDoubleClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::legendDoubleClick(QCPLegend *legend,  QCPAbstractLegendItem *item,
  QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when a legend (item) is double clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click, \a legend is the legend that received the
  click and \a item is the legend item that received the click. If only the legend and no item is
  clicked, \a item is \c nullptr. This happens for a click inside the legend padding or the space
  between two items.

  \see legendClick
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::selectionChangedByUser()

  This signal is emitted after the user has changed the selection in the QCustomPlot, e.g. by
  clicking. It is not emitted when the selection state of an object has changed programmatically by
  a direct call to <tt>setSelected()</tt>/<tt>setSelection()</tt> on an object or by calling \ref
  deselectAll.

  In addition to this signal, selectable objects also provide individual signals, for example \ref
  QCPAxis::selectionChanged or \ref QCPAbstractPlottable::selectionChanged. Note that those signals
  are emitted even if the selection state is changed programmatically.

  See the documentation of \ref setInteractions for details about the selection mechanism.

  \see selectedPlottables, selectedGraphs, selectedItems, selectedAxes, selectedLegends
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::beforeReplot()

  This signal is emitted immediately before a replot takes place (caused by a call to the slot \ref
  replot).

  It is safe to mutually connect the replot slot with this signal on two QCustomPlots to make them
  replot synchronously, it won't cause an infinite recursion.

  \see replot, afterReplot, afterLayout
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::afterLayout()

  This signal is emitted immediately after the layout step has been completed, which occurs right
  before drawing the plot. This is typically during a call to \ref replot, and in such cases this
  signal is emitted in between the signals \ref beforeReplot and \ref afterReplot. Unlike those
  signals however, this signal is also emitted during off-screen painting, such as when calling
  \ref toPixmap or \ref savePdf.

  The layout step queries all layouts and layout elements in the plot for their proposed size and
  arranges the objects accordingly as preparation for the subsequent drawing step. Through this
  signal, you have the opportunity to update certain things in your plot that depend crucially on
  the exact dimensions/positioning of layout elements such as axes and axis rects.

  \warning However, changing any parameters of this QCustomPlot instance which would normally
  affect the layouting (e.g. axis range order of magnitudes, tick label sizes, etc.) will not issue
  a second run of the layout step. It will propagate directly to the draw step and may cause
  graphical inconsistencies such as overlapping objects, if sizes or positions have changed.

  \see updateLayout, beforeReplot, afterReplot
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::afterReplot()

  This signal is emitted immediately after a replot has taken place (caused by a call to the slot
  \ref replot).

  It is safe to mutually connect the replot slot with this signal on two QCustomPlots to make them
  replot synchronously, it won't cause an infinite recursion.

/*! \var QCPAxis *QCustomPlot::xAxis

  A pointer to the primary x Axis (bottom) of the main axis rect of the plot.

  QCustomPlot offers convenient pointers to the axes (\ref xAxis, \ref yAxis, \ref xAxis2, \ref
  yAxis2) and the \ref legend. They make it very easy working with plots that only have a single
  axis rect and at most one axis at each axis rect side. If you use \link thelayoutsystem the
  layout system\endlink to add multiple axis rects or multiple axes to one side, use the \ref
  QCPAxisRect::axis interface to access the new axes. If one of the four default axes or the
  default legend is removed due to manipulation of the layout system (e.g. by removing the main
  axis rect), the corresponding pointers become \c nullptr.

  If an axis convenience pointer is currently \c nullptr and a new axis rect or a corresponding
  axis is added in the place of the main axis rect, QCustomPlot resets the convenience pointers to
  the according new axes. Similarly the \ref legend convenience pointer will be reset if a legend
  is added after the main legend was removed before.

  enums. There are the following types of interactions:

  <b>Axis range manipulation</b> is controlled via \ref QCP::iRangeDrag and \ref QCP::iRangeZoom.
  When the respective interaction is enabled, the user may drag axes ranges and zoom with the mouse
  wheel. For details how to control which axes the user may drag/zoom and in what orientations, see
  \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag, \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoom, \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes,
  \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomAxes.

  <b>Plottable data selection</b> is controlled by \ref QCP::iSelectPlottables. If \ref
  QCP::iSelectPlottables is set, the user may select plottables (graphs, curves, bars,...) and
  their data by clicking on them or in their vicinity (\ref setSelectionTolerance). Whether the
  user can actually select a plottable and its data can further be restricted with the \ref
  QCPAbstractPlottable::setSelectable method on the specific plottable. For details, see the
  special page about the \ref dataselection "data selection mechanism". To retrieve a list of all
  currently selected plottables, call \ref selectedPlottables. If you're only interested in
  QCPGraphs, you may use the convenience function \ref selectedGraphs.

  <b>Item selection</b> is controlled by \ref QCP::iSelectItems. If \ref QCP::iSelectItems is set,
  the user may select items (QCPItemLine, QCPItemText,...) by clicking on them or in their vicinity.
  To find out whether a specific item is selected, call QCPAbstractItem::selected(). To retrieve a
  list of all currently selected items, call \ref selectedItems.

  <b>Axis selection</b> is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectAxes. If \ref QCP::iSelectAxes is set,
  the user may select parts of the axes by clicking on them. What parts exactly (e.g. Axis base
  line, tick labels, axis label) are selectable can be controlled via \ref
  QCPAxis::setSelectableParts for each axis. To retrieve a list of all axes that currently contain
  selected parts, call \ref selectedAxes. Which parts of an axis are selected, can be retrieved with
  QCPAxis::selectedParts().

  <b>Legend selection</b> is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectLegend. If this is set, the user may
  select the legend itself or individual items by clicking on them. What parts exactly are
  selectable can be controlled via \ref QCPLegend::setSelectableParts. To find out whether the
  legend or any of its child items are selected, check the value of QCPLegend::selectedParts. To
  find out which child items are selected, call \ref QCPLegend::selectedItems.

  <b>All other selectable elements</b> The selection of all other selectable objects (e.g.
  QCPTextElement, or your own layerable subclasses) is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectOther. If
  set, the user may select those objects by clicking on them. To find out which are currently
  selected, you need to check their selected state explicitly.

  If the selection state has changed by user interaction, the \ref selectionChangedByUser signal is
  emitted. Each selectable object additionally emits an individual selectionChanged signal whenever
  their selection state has changed, i.e. not only by user interaction.

  To allow multiple objects to be selected by holding the selection modifier (\ref
  setMultiSelectModifier), set the flag \ref QCP::iMultiSelect.

  \note In addition to the selection mechanism presented here, QCustomPlot always emits
  corresponding signals, when an object is clicked or double clicked. see \ref plottableClick and
  \ref plottableDoubleClick for example.

  If you wish to provide your user both with axis range dragging and data selection/range zooming,
  use this method to switch between the modes just before the interaction is processed, e.g. in
  reaction to the \ref mousePress or \ref mouseMove signals. For example you could check whether
  the user is holding a certain keyboard modifier, and then decide which \a mode shall be set.

  If a selection rect interaction is currently active, and \a mode is set to \ref QCP::srmNone, the
  interaction is canceled (\ref QCPSelectionRect::cancel). Switching between any of the other modes

  Causes a complete replot into the internal paint buffer(s). Finally, the widget surface is
  refreshed with the new buffer contents. This is the method that must be called to make changes to
  the plot, e.g. on the axis ranges or data points of graphs, visible.

  The parameter \a refreshPriority can be used to fine-tune the timing of the replot. For example
  if your application calls \ref replot very quickly in succession (e.g. multiple independent
  functions change some aspects of the plot and each wants to make sure the change gets replotted),
  it is advisable to set \a refreshPriority to \ref QCustomPlot::rpQueuedReplot. This way, the
  actual replotting is deferred to the next event loop iteration. Multiple successive calls of \ref
  replot with this priority will only cause a single replot, avoiding redundant replots and
  improving performance.

  Under a few circumstances, QCustomPlot causes a replot by itself. Those are resize events of the
  QCustomPlot widget and user interactions (object selection and range dragging/zooming).

  Before the replot happens, the signal \ref beforeReplot is emitted. After the replot, \ref
  afterReplot is emitted. It is safe to mutually connect the replot slot with any of those two
  signals on two QCustomPlots to make them replot synchronously, it won't cause an infinite
  recursion.

  If a layer is in mode \ref QCPLayer::lmBuffered (\ref QCPLayer::setMode), it is also possible to
  replot only that specific layer via \ref QCPLayer::replot. See the documentation there for
  details.

  Saves a PDF with the vectorized plot to the file \a fileName. The axis ratio as well as the scale

  drawing to the PDF file. Cosmetic pens are pens with numerical width 0, which are always drawn as
  a one pixel wide line, no matter what zoom factor is set in the PDF-Viewer. For more information
  about cosmetic pens, see the QPainter and QPen documentation.

  \warning
  \li If you plan on editing the exported PDF file with a vector graphics editor like Inkscape, it
  is advised to set \a exportPen to \ref QCP::epNoCosmetic to avoid losing those cosmetic lines

  \li If calling this function inside the constructor of the parent of the QCustomPlot widget

  explicit non-zero widths and heights. If you leave \a width or \a height as 0 (default), this
  function uses the current width and height of the QCustomPlot widget. However, in Qt, these
  aren't defined yet inside the constructor, so you would get an image that has strange
  widths/heights.

  Saves a PNG image file to \a fileName on disc. The output plot will have the dimensions \a width

  current width and height of the QCustomPlot widget is used instead. Line widths and texts etc.
  are not scaled up when larger widths/heights are used. If you want that effect, use the \a scale
  parameter.

  For example, if you set both \a width and \a height to 100 and \a scale to 2, you will end up with
  an image file of size 200*200 in which all graphical elements are scaled up by factor 2 (line
  widths, texts, etc.). This scaling is not done by stretching a 100*100 image, the result will have
  full 200*200 pixel resolution.

  If you use a high scaling factor, it is recommended to enable antialiasing for all elements by
  temporarily setting \ref QCustomPlot::setAntialiasedElements to \ref QCP::aeAll as this allows
  QCustomPlot to place objects with sub-pixel accuracy.

  image compression can be controlled with the \a quality parameter which must be between 0 and 100
  or -1 to use the default setting.

  The \a resolution will be written to the image file header and has no direct consequence for the
  quality or the pixel size. However, if opening the image with a tool which respects the metadata,
  it will be able to scale the image to match either a given size in real units of length (inch,
  centimeters, etc.), or the target display DPI. You can specify in which units \a resolution is
  given, by setting \a resolutionUnit. The \a resolution is converted to the format's expected
  resolution unit internally.

  Returns true on success. If this function fails, most likely the PNG format isn't supported by
  the system, see Qt docs about QImageWriter::supportedImageFormats().

  This method is called when a simple left mouse click was detected on the QCustomPlot surface.

  It first determines the layerable that was hit by the click, and then calls its \ref
  QCPLayerable::selectEvent. All other layerables receive a QCPLayerable::deselectEvent (unless the
  multi-select modifier was pressed, see \ref setMultiSelectModifier).

  In this method the hit layerable is determined a second time using \ref layerableAt (after the
  one in \ref mousePressEvent), because we want \a onlySelectable set to true this time. This
  implies that the mouse event grabber (mMouseEventLayerable) may be a different one from the
  clicked layerable determined here. For example, if a non-selectable layerable is in front of a
  selectable layerable at the click position, the front layerable will receive mouse events but the
  selectable one in the back will receive the \ref QCPLayerable::selectEvent.
